# bernina_1090s_manual

## Overview

A [ScanTailor](https://scantailor.org/) project to fix up the [scanned manual](https://www.bernina.com/bernina/media/Support/Sewing_Quilting_Embroidery/Out_of_Print_Manuals/BERNINA-Model-1090-S-Manual.pdf) provided by [Bernina](https://www.bernina.com).

The Bernina-provided document includes the binding and is skewed. This project resolves that.

## Output

Download the fixed up manual on the [releases page](https://github.com/aerickson/bernina_1090s_manual/releases).

## Notes on using this project

If you'd like to hack on this, make sure to edit the paths (there are 2 spots) in the ScanTailor file.

### Getting ScanTailor on Mac
